    Overview:

        Shader program 'th':
            Get shader desc: th_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: th_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_th_vs_pos = 0
                    ATTR_th_vs_uv0 = 1
                    ATTR_th_vs_color0 = 2
            Fragment shader: th_fs
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Sample Type: SG_IMAGESAMPLETYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0
                Sampler 'smp':
                    Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FILTERING
                    Bind slot: SLOT_smp = 0
                Image Sampler Pair 'tex_smp':
                    Image: tex
                    Sampler: smp


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader th = sg_make_shader(th_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'th_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_th_vs_pos] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_th_vs_uv0] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_th_vs_color0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});


    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]

        SLOT_smp = 0;
