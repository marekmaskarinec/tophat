# snake example

This is an example of snake implementation in tophat. Don't switch screens the same way i do it. i will make example for a better way soon.

## how to run

in blank directory run `tophat init`. then replace the default game file with this one. you can then use `tophat run` to run it or `tophat package linux snake` to package it.
